# RISC-V Single-Cycle CPU Design and Simulation

This project implements a single-cycle RISC-V processor supporting the RV32I instruction set architecture. The CPU design includes core components such as the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Register File, Control Unit, Immediate Generator, Program Counter (PC), and Instruction Memory.

## Features
- Supports key instructions including arithmetic (`addi`), memory access (`lw`, `sw`), and logic operations.
- Designed and coded in Verilog HDL.
- Simulated and verified functionality using Vivado Design Suite.
- Modular RTL design enabling easy extension and testing.

## Technologies Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado Simulator

## Usage
- Run simulations on Vivado with included testbenches to verify instruction execution.
- Integrate and extend modules for more complex CPU designs or pipelined architectures.
